# Visualisation-of-space-missions & Tensorflow implementation
Part I:
This is a project completed to visualise the space mission using R  and shiny . R libraries  and shiny is used to mainly focus on NASA & SpaceX. Moreover it focuses on the space missions undertaken by various organisation public or private . Additionally the focus has been on the sites used for Space missions.
Part II:
In this i have implemented the Tensorflow on abalone dataset and then working on RNN as well CNN .Moreover Tensorflow is an area of interest to me.
